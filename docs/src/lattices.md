# Lattices

The package ships with a couple of standard lattices

 * [MonteCarlo.Chain](@ref Lattices)
 * [MonteCarlo.SquareLattice](@ref Lattices)
 * [MonteCarlo.CubicLattice](@ref Lattices)

 It also provides routines to load the following common lattice formats

 * [MonteCarlo.ALPSLattice](@ref Lattices)

## Didn't find your desired lattice?

Just implement your own lattice for later use in a model of choice. See [Custom lattices](@ref).
